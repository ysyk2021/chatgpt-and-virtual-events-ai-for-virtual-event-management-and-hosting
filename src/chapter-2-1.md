A virtual event is an online gathering that allows people to come together digitally instead of physically. These events can be hosted on a variety of digital platforms, such as webinars, conferences, trade shows, and networking events. They can also include interactive elements, such as live Q\&A sessions, chat rooms, and virtual booths.

Virtual events can be accessed from anywhere in the world, making them more accessible to a wider audience. They can also be more cost-effective than traditional in-person events, as they eliminate the need for travel and venue rental expenses.
